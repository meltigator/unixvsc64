💻 UNIX vs C64: Bridging Modern Tools and Retro Computing

 I’ve created a fun script called “unix vs c64” that sets up a full Commodore 64 development environment on MSYS2. With just one script, you can:

 ✅ Install the CC65 cross-compiler
 ✅ Install the VICE C64 emulator
 ✅ Compile and run a blinking Hello World program on a virtual Commodore 64

This playful experiment shows how easily modern UNIX-like environments can talk to 8-bit retro machines.

Let’s bring some old-school magic back to life! ✨🕹️
